# Gravity-Game

A 2D space game in C++/OpenGL

Split-screen game where two players can fly around with space ships and shoot at eachother or at asteroids â€” and watch out for planets that affect their ships and the asteroids with gravitational force.

Project done in a team of five members, out of which 3 where mainly involved in the programming. The OOP design was made solely by me, as was most of the implementation of the game and view modules.
